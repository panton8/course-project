## Project Description

It's a simple game.
First sign up for the league at Fantasy Premier League.
After the registration process you would be given £100 million to select a squad of 15 players from a pool of players who play in the Premier League.
For every matchday your team will be awarded point based on the player performance in that matchday. Point based on the player position and his performance
So your Matchday score is the sum total of your players score.
You will be allowed do transfers using which you can replace a player in your squad.
Your points are totalled for each match week. By default you will be enrolled in a league between all users.
